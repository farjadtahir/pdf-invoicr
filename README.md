## Introduction

PHP Invoice is a simple object oriented PHP class to generate beautifully designed invoices, quotes
or orders with just a few lines of code. Brand it with your own logo and theme color, add unlimited
items and total rows with automatic paging. You can deliver the PDF ouput in the user's browser,
save on the server or force a file download. PHP Invoice is fully customizable and can be integrated
into any well known CMS.

### Multi-languages & Currencies

PHP Invoice has built in translations in English, Dutch, French, German, Spanish and Italian (you
can easily add your own if needed) and you can set the currency needed per document.

### Additional Titles, Paragraphs And Badges

Extra content (titles and multi-line paragraphs) can be added to the bottom of the document. You
might use it for payment or shipping information or any other content needed.

## Installation

```bash
composer require luisinder/pdf-invoice
```

## Examples

There are 3 examples included in the `examples/` folder of this repo:
- simple.php
- example1.php
- example2.php
- change_timezone.php


### Create A New Invoice

> Make sure that the default php date timezone is set before using the class.

In this simple example we are generating an invoice with custom logo and theme color. It will
contain 2 products and a box on the bottom with VAT and total price. Then we add a "Paid" badge
right before the output.

```php
use Konekt\PdfInvoice\InvoicePrinter;

  $invoice = new InvoicePrinter();

  /* Header settings */
  $invoice->setLogo("images/sample1.jpg");   //logo image path
  $invoice->setColor("#007fff");      // pdf color scheme
  $invoice->setType("Sale Invoice");    // Invoice Type
  $invoice->setReference("INV-55033645");   // Reference
  $invoice->setDate(date('M dS ,Y',time()));   //Billing Date
  $invoice->setTime(date('h:i:s A',time()));   //Billing Time
  $invoice->setDue(date('M dS ,Y',strtotime('+3 months')));    // Due Date
  $invoice->setFrom(array("Seller Name","Sample Company Name","128 AA Juanita Ave","Glendora , CA 91740"));
  $invoice->setTo(array("Purchaser Name","Sample Company Name","128 AA Juanita Ave","Glendora , CA 91740"));

  $invoice->addItem("AMD Athlon X2DC-7450","2.4GHz/1GB/160GB/SMP-DVD/VB",6,0,580,0,3480);
  $invoice->addItem("PDC-E5300","2.6GHz/1GB/320GB/SMP-DVD/FDD/VB",4,0,645,0,2580);
  $invoice->addItem('LG 18.5" WLCD',"",10,0,230,0,2300);
  $invoice->addItem("HP LaserJet 5200","",1,0,1100,0,1100);

  $invoice->addTotal("Total",9460);
  $invoice->addTotal("VAT 21%",1986.6);
  $invoice->addTotal("Total due",11446.6,true);

  $invoice->addBadge("Payment Paid");

  $invoice->addTitle("Important Notice");

  $invoice->addParagraph("No item will be replaced or refunded if you don't have the invoice with you.");

  $invoice->setFooternote("My Company Name Here");

  $invoice->render('example1.pdf','I');
  /* I => Display on browser, D => Force Download, F => local path save, S => return document as string */
```
